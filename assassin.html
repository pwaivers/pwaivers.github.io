        <h1>Welcome to Tribe Assassin - April 27, 2020</h1>
        <p>
            I am your handler, Linus. Welcome back to Assassin.
            The prize is a $50 Amazon gift card.  
            However, this time the prize will be split between <b>two players: the last the player standing and the player with the most kills</b>.
            The last player standing will still be the WINNER, but the player with the most kills will split the prize money with the winner.
            If there is a tie for most kills, then the tie-breaker will be the player that survived the longest.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Here are the general rules:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The game begins with each participant being assigned a target for assassination.  
            </li>
            <li>
                With each kill, the successful assassin moves on acquiring their victim's assigned target, and the victim eliminated from the Game.  
            </li>
            <li>
                A target may be killed using "hand-to-hand" or "weapons".
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hand-to-hand kills are accomplished by tapping a target on the shoulder. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Weapons include balls of paper, rolled up cloth, foam projectiles, and other soft projectiles.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                For a kill to be valid, both players have to be in the fair play area. I.e. you cannot throw a projectile from inside the wfh area to hit a player outside the wfh area. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You may kill your assassin in self defense, called a <b>self-defense kill</b>.  Doing so eliminates them from the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any kill that is not your target or a self-defense kill is called an <b>unsanctioned kill</b>. 
                Unsanctioned kills will lead to more assassins being assigned you as a target.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: Unsanctioned kills <b>do</do> count towards your total kill count for the "most kills" victory.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game ends when only one assassin is left alive. There is no time limit. 
            </li>
        </ol>
