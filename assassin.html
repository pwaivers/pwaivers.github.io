        <h1>Welcome to Tribe Assassin - April 27, 2020</h1>
        <h2>The Winner is Sarah "Silent But Deadly" Xie</h2>
        <p>
            I am your handler, Linus. Welcome back to Assassin.
            The prize is a $50 Amazon gift card.  
            However, this time the prize will be split between <b>two players: the last the player standing and the player with the most kills</b>.
            The last player standing will still be the WINNER, but the player with the most kills will split the prize money with the winner.
            If there is a tie for most kills, then the tie-breaker will be the player that survived the longest.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Here are the general rules:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The game begins with each participant being assigned a target for assassination.  
            </li>
            <li>
                With each kill, the successful assassin moves on acquiring their victim's assigned target, and the victim eliminated from the Game.  
            </li>
            <li>
                A target may be killed using "hand-to-hand" or "weapons".
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hand-to-hand kills are accomplished by tapping a target on the shoulder. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Weapons include balls of paper, rolled up cloth, foam projectiles, and other soft projectiles.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                For a kill to be valid, both players have to be in the fair play area. I.e. you cannot throw a projectile from inside the wfh area to hit a player outside the wfh area. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You may kill your assassin in self defense, called a <b>self-defense kill</b>.  Doing so eliminates them from the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any kill that is not your target or a self-defense kill is called an <b>unsanctioned kill</b>. 
                Unsanctioned kills will lead to more assassins being assigned you as a target.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game ends when only one assassin is left alive. There is no time limit. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The player with the most kills will split the prize with the last player standing
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If there are multiple players tied with the most kills, the tiebreaker will be the player who survived the longest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unsanctioned kills <b>do</b> count towards your total kill count for the "most kills" victory.
                    </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Some days may require a <b>Rendezvous with Linus</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Each alive player MUST rendezvous with Linus at least once during the day</li>
                    <li>The rendezvous must take place during specified hours, and not any other time. Linus is a busy penguin.</li>
                    <li>The first rendezvous will take place in the kitchen between either 7-8pm.</li>
                    <li>Linus will hand you a trinket or treat, and the rendezvous is complete</li>
                    <li>If you do not complete the rendezvous, you will be disqualified at midnight</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

                    Getting Too Comfortable [2019-04-27 12:03pm] - The reigning champ <b>Jay "Jaywalker" Lee</b> was struck down in the kitchen in the open moments of the game.  
                        The killer goes by the codename "Nehal".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Racking up Kills [3:15pm] - <b>Kyle "Florida Man" Morris</b> was a victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
                    Derek "Nehal" Pankeaw was attacking anyone that looks like an assassin, presumably to get the "most kills" victory.
                    He performed an <em>unsanctioned kill</em> on "Florida Man".  
                    There were also several bystander casualties, but we legally cannot reveal their names.
                </li>
                <li>
                     Ending the Rampage [3:17pm] - Before Linus could label him a persona-non-grata, <b>Derek "Nehal" Pankeaw</b> was gunned down by another assassin.
                     His attack was quickly squelched by the assassin "Silent But Deadly".
                     "Silent But Deadly" performed an <em>unsanctioned kill</em>, but was not punished. 
                </li>
                <li>
                      Couching Tiger Hidden Glofbaloff [3:46pm] - In a non-so-sneak attack, "Sir Glofbaloff McPugsly the Third Jr." delivered a flying yeti strike to <b>Matt "Nameless" Chang</b>.
                      Matt was sitting on the couch, unsuspecting of the ancient warrior pouncing from the brush.  It was a fatal blow.
                </li>
                <li>
                      It's a Trap! [5:21pm] - "Silent But Deadly" lured <b>Wonk "Sir Glofbaloff McPugsly the Third Jr." Wonkubus</b> into the theater and assassinated him there.
                      The only thing left behind was sacred blade, Blood Drinker Excalibur. This was a <em>defensive kill</em>. Well done "Silent But Deadly"!
                </li>
                <li>
                      Why Are The So Many Nehals? [5:50pm] - "Silent But Deadly" strikes again! 
                      True to the name, "Silent But Deadly" waited at the bottom of the stairs and pelted <b>Nehal "Necromancer" Shastri</b> as he descended.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    A <b>Rendezvous With Linus</b> was called for April 28. 
                    The surviving three players must meet Patrick in the kitchen between 7-8pm.   
                </li>

                    Dirty Laundry [2:57pm] - <b>Taylor "Mike Hancho" Kennon</b> was ambushed and killed in the laundry by Sarah "Silent But Deadly" Xie.
                    She disguised herself as a pile of dirty laundry and launched at him as he walked by. 
                    A battled ensued, but a barrage of fruit snacks ultimately dealt the fatal blow
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sarah "Silent But Deadly" Xie won both last standing and most kills.
