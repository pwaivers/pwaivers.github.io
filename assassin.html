        <h1>Welcome to Tribe Assassin: Part 2</h1>
        <p>
            I am your handler, Linus. This is the second iteration of the game Assassin. 
            I used the same rules as the first game, but I may change them to my whim. 
            The prize is a $50 Amazon gift card.
            If any rules are unclear, ask Linus (or his assistant Patrick) for any clarifications.
            Updates will be sent out over email and added here. 
            Successful assassinations will also be posted here in the last section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important thing to know is that this game based on the honor system, so please be honest.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Here are the general rules:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The game begins with each participant being assigned a target for assassination.  
            </li>
            <li>
                With each kill, the successful assassin moves on acquiring their victim's assigned target, and the victim eliminated from the Game.  
            </li>
            <li>
                A target may be killed using "hand-to-hand" or "weapons".
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hand-to-hand kills are accomplished by tapping a target on the shoulder. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Weapons include balls of paper, rolled up cloth, foam projectiles, and other soft projectiles.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                You may kill your assassin in self defense, called a <b>self-defense kill</b>.  Doing so eliminates them from the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any kill that is not your target or a self-defense kill is called an <b>unsanctioned kill</b>. 
                Unsanctioned kills will lead to more assassins being assigned you as a target.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game ends when only one assassin is left alive. There is no time limit. 
            </li>
        </ol>

            <li>

            <li>
                Bad for Business - <b>Dan "Darkhorse" Frysinger</b> was on a business call when an assassin walked and did the deed.  He did not pull through.
