        <h1>Welcome to Tribe Assassin: Part 2</h1>
        <p>
            I am your handler, Linus. This is the second iteration of the game Assassin. 
            I used the same rules as the first game, but I may change them to my whim. 
            The prize is a $50 Amazon gift card.
            If any rules are unclear, ask Linus (or his assistant Patrick) for any clarifications.
            Updates will be sent out over email and added here. 
            Successful assassinations will also be posted here in the last section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important thing to know is that this game based on the honor system, so please be honest. And HAVE FUN!
        </p>
        <h2>
            Here are the general rules:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The game begins with each participant being assigned a target for assassination.  
            </li>
            <li>
                With each kill, the successful assassin moves on acquiring their victim's assigned target, and the victim eliminated from the Game.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Kills: A target can be killed using "weapons" or "hand-to-hand" defined below.
            </li>
            <li>
                Self Defense Kills:  You may kill your assassin in self defense.  Doing so eliminates them from The Game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unsanctioned Kills:  While unsanctioned kills other than self-defense aren't necessarily forbidden, it is not recommended.  Unsanctioned kills will lead to more assassins being assigned you as a target.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game ends when only 1 assassin is left alive. There is no time limit. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>How to kill your target</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hand-to-hand kills are accomplished by tapping a target on the shoulder. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Weapons include balls of paper, rolled up cloth, foam projectiles, and other soft projectiles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Timed "explosives" or "poisons" are NOT permitted.
            </li>
