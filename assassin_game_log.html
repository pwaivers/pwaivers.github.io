            <li>
                Early Bird Gets the Worm - In the first seconds of the game, <b>Brendan "Shoelace" Whiting</b> was stabbed in the back while getting food from his fridge, by a player with codename "Nehal".
            </li>
            <li>
                Tragedy Comes in Pairs - Less than a minute later, <b>Derek "Galileo" Pankeaw</b> was killed in hand-to-combat as he walked into the kitcken with his lunch. The assassin "M. Hancho" was quick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bad for Business - <b>Dan "Darkhorse" Frysinger</b> was on a business call when the assassin "Nehal" attacked him.  Dan did not pull through.  "Nehal" is on a roll.
            </li>
            <li>
                UNSANCTIONED KILL - <b>Taylor "M. Hancho" Kennon</b> was gunned down by close friend.  This was an unsanctioned kill.  "Murdleblorff" is now a persona-non-grata.
            </li>
            <li>
                Karma's a B$#@* - <b>Wonk "Murdleblorff" Wonkubus</b> has been eliminated by the assassin "Survivor".  
                "Survivor" waited for him on the living room, aimed for the chest, and executed as he walked through the door. 
                "Murdleblorff" spilled his drink everywhere in surprise.
            </li>
            <li>
                UNSANCTIONED KILL - <b>Matt Chang</b> was taken down in his prime.  
                He has just recently completed fixing the internet, when assassin "Erick" snuck up in the halway and did the deed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dial M for Murder - <b>Nehal "Necromancer" Shastri</b> was just walking to the movie room, presumably for April 20th celebrations. 
                Little did he know that "Survivor" was hot on his tail.  "Necromancer" didn't stand a chance.   
            </li>
            <li>
                Pop the Champagne - Four housemates got an interview with Y Combinator.  Time to drink champagne! 
                However, celebrations were cut short when "Erick" tapped Erik "Nehal" Dunteman on the shoulder, resulting in the latter's immediate death. 
                Better stick to entrepreneurship, "Nehal".
            </li>
            <li>
                Stair Chase - Kyle "Erick" Morris was walking down the stairs after recently leaving quarantine.
                "Survivor" ran down the stairs after him and struck him with a tiny orange in the head. 
            </li>
            <li>
                History Repeats Itself - Sarah "Survivor" Xie was gunned down in the kitchen couch area. 
                "Jaywalker" knew her whereabouts and struck when she least suspected. He called it 'payback'.
            </li>
            <li>
                Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner - Jay "Jaywalker" Lee was not killed.
